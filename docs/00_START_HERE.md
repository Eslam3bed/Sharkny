## 🎯 The Project in a Nutshell

### Problem We're Solving
Friends want to easily split restaurant bills without manual calculations

### Our Solution
1. 📸 Take a photo of the bill
2. 🤖 AI extracts items and prices
3. ✅ Select which items each person had
4. 💰 Auto-calculate fair shares (with tax & tips)
5. 🎉 Everyone knows what they owe

### Tech Stack
```
Frontend:  Remix + React + shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS + TypeScript
Backend:   Remix Server Routes + Node.js
AI:        OpenAI Vision API
Database:  MongoDB (flexible, no schema)
Deployment: Railway.app
```

### Key Stats
- **Phases**: 7 (Setup → Deploy)
- **Tasks**: 29 (All documented)
- **Build Time**: ~6 hours
- **Deployment**: 30 minutes
- **Code Files**: 10+ (templates provided)
- **Documentation**: 2,250 lines
- **Code Examples**: 20+
